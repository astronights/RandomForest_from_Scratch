# COMP3314: Machine Learning Assignment 1

## Random Forest Classifier

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following libraries:

- [Numpy](http://numpy.org)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [scikit-learn (Only for testing)](http://scikit-learn.org/stable)

### Code

The relevant files are provided in the 3035345306_A1 directory. 

### Files Needed

The dataset_files directory is required to be in the same location as the test.py script.
